#MeteorCMS - development v0.1

Last ReadMe Update: 3/4/2014
IMPORTANT: This CMS is in development and there *will* be bugs and somethings won't look pretty.

I love the Wordpress admin interface but *hate* the markup that Wordpress produces. So I started working on a CMS where I could control the markup, and take advantage of the speed of Meteor. As noted, this is a *VERY* basic CMS that allows a user to create pages, posts, and post categories. This CMS was and will always be built for developers with knowledge of javascript, HTML5 and CSS. Knowledge of the Meteor.js templating system will also allow for further customization.

##Example

Here is a [live example](http://ramsay.meteor.com/) of the CMS in action. As of the moment of this writing, there are no pages or posts added. Visit the [admin login](http://ramsay.meteor.com/admin) page and login using the Username: Admin and Password: Admin to access the backend. 

##Setup

First, install Meteor if you haven't done so. Check out the [Meteor docs](http://docs.meteor.com/) for more info.

```bash
$curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```
Also, you might want to install Meteorite [atmosphere.meteor.com](https://atmosphere.meteor.com). Meteorite is a Meteor package manager that allows you to install many unofficial packages for further expansion.

Then, make a new directory for the app
```bash
$ mkdir MeteorCMS
```

Next, clone MeteorCMS to the new directory

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ramsaylanier/MeteorCMS.git MeteorCMS
```

Finally, start the Meteor server
```bash
$ cd MeteorCMS
$ Meteor
```
